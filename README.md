# Automation for inventory
in this project I developed several methods related to inventory.
- add_product - add specific product to the inventory
- remove_product - remove specific product from the inventory
- get_product - get specific product from the inventory
- total_inventory_value - return the total_inventory_value


## installation guide
 - download the repository
 - install python to your computer
 - after you open the project in pycharm or another tool, run this on your terminal:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
